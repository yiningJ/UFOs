## Summary

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Firstly, we can conclude that May is the best month of the year to launch campaign in theatre but be prepared for the fierce competition.
- Secondly, usually there are more successful campaigns in theatres compared to failed ones except in December, which could be attributed to that people go for vacations in holiday.
