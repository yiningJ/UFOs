# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
By adding additional filters and better searching experience to the webpage and dynamic table, users can easily find UFO sighting information by applying multiple criterias at the same time.

## Results

### 
As we see the theme is consistent across the whole page by applying CLASS.

After we apply the new changes, more searching options have been provided, see image below.

And we are allowing users to apply multiple criterias to see the updated table as image shown below.

## Summary

### Drawback and recommendations
Right now users need to click on somewhere else on the page to launch the filter change, which is not very convenient. 
I recommend to add a button for users to click on after finish inserting the filter. Also we should provide a dropdown list for users to select from because it's very hard for user to know all the options.
